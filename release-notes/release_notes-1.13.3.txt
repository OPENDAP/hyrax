This version of Hyrax is bug fix release. It uses version 3.18.3 of libdap, version 3.17.4
of the BES and version xxx of the OLFS

Bug fix for DAP4 data transmissions.

XML Parser fixes for DAP4: We are now tolerant of elements that
are not in the DAP4 namespace, so the DMR document can be extended
with additional information without breaking our parser.

D4Group's clone (aka ptr_duplicate) method returned a D4Group and not
a BaseType; fixed.

A bug with logrotate was crashing the server.

Hyrax-282 fixed (Aggregations crash the BES when a response as netcdf
or netcdf-4 is requested). This problem was actually that any Grid
subset so that only some of the elements are sent broke the netcdf
handler.

Patched the HDF4 handler code so that the source dist contains needed
testing scripts/templates.
