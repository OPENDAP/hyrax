Set up a conda environment that includes:
netCDF4 pip numpy matplotlib cartopy basemap requests xarray dask ipykernel

After installing Anaconda's free version, use

    conda create --name opendap pip numpy matplotlib cartopy basemap requests xarray dask ipykernel

That makes an 'opendap' environment and loads the packages pip, ..., ipykernel into
the environment. Now switch to the enviroment

    conda activate opendap

Use pip to install pydap

    pip install pydap

NB: You might not need to use pip for pydap and might not need ipykernel

## Tweaking the conda install to coexist with the OPeNDAP/Hyrax C++ build

Add this to the bottom of ~/.bashrc:

function conda_on() {
    source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate base
}

Then in ~/.bash_profile:

# I removed the following because the 'conda' system clashes with
# our dependencies (well, the icu library it uses does). jhrg 4/24/2019

# added by Anaconda3 2019.03 installer
# >>> conda init >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
# __conda_setup="$(CONDA_REPORT_ERRORS=false '/Users/jimg/anaconda3/bin/conda' shell.bash hook 2> /dev/null)"
# if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
#     \eval "$__conda_setup"
# else
#     if [ -f "/Users/jimg/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
#         . "/Users/jimg/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
#         CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base
#     else
#         \export PATH="/Users/jimg/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
#     fi
# fi
# unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda init <<<

With the above left in place, every shell will have the default conda environment
(base) and as I say above, as of 4/24/2019, that broke the ICU library on OSX.
By removing the above code and having the function 'conda-on' shown previously,
the normal shell is unaltered. Once you run 'conda-on' then that shell is a conda
shell and should not be used for Hyrax builds.
