Set up a conda environment that includes:
netCDF4 pip numpy matplotlib cartopy basemap requests xarray dask ipykernel

After installing Anaconda's free version, use

    conda create --name opendap pip numpy matplotlib cartopy basemap requests xarray dask ipykernel

That makes an 'opendap' environment and loads the packages pip, ..., ipykernel into
the environment. Now switch to the enviroment

    conda activate opendap

Use pip to install pydap

    pip install pydap

NB: You might not need to use pip for pydap and might not need ipykernel
